    <h2>Libra (September 23 - October 22)</h2>
    <p>Balance, harmony, and justice define Libra energy. As a cardinal air sign, Libra is represented by the scales (interestingly, the only inanimate object of the zodiac), an association that reflects Libra's fixation on establishing equilibrium. Libra is obsessed with symmetry and strives to create equilibrium in all areas of life â€” especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Read your sign's full profile here.
